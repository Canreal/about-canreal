# Where do I find the code of Canreal?
Canreal is partly Open Source. You can clone any of our projects to help with the development of Canreal. You can also use our projects based on the license you can find within every repository. Please note, that we try to make as much as possibe of Canreal Open Source. However, we can't make everything Open Source, because we want to create something unique with Canreal. It's not our goal to make the work for other servers. Our goal is to give you a good insight into our code with the possibility for you to use it for your own projects, without copying us 1:1. Thank you for understanding this! :)

# But what is Canreal?
Canreal is a Hytale based MMORPG-Server currently in development. Because the game Hytale itself is currently in development, too, our focus is currently on the website development and on planning quests, cities and so on. As soon as Hytale gets release we will begin to develop our plugins and more! You could say Canreal will be a game based on another game. Therefore this project will get very big over time. Our goal is to release Canreal in English and add support for other languages in the future, too. If you want to read more about Canreal you can head over to the [official Wiki](https://canreal.net/wiki "Official Canreal Wiki")!
